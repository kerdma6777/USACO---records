# USACO---records
This program was written for the December edition of the [United States Computing Olympiad](usaco.org) 2013-2014 competition.  It was written in Java.  As per competition rules, after this program and two others were simultaneously released, I had four hours to complete as much as I could. 

#Program Description
 The full program description can be found [here](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=358).  

In summary, lines containing three names separated by a space are read in.  The same three names can sometimes be found on separate lines, either in the same order or a different order.  The objective is to determine the greatest number of reoccurrences of a single group of names, regardless of name order. 

#Input
The first line is an integer value equal to the number of lines of names that will follow.  The concurrent lines each have three names separated by a space.  

#Sample
